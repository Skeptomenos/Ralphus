## I. The Explosion

AGI is here. Not in some theoretical future. *Now.*

But here's what nobody is telling you: AGI is an explosion with no direction.

It's infinite capability waiting to be channeled. Raw superintelligence with nowhere to go. Left alone, it just produces noise. Beautiful, impressive, coherent-sounding noise—but noise.

What AGI needs is **infrastructure**. Tracks to run on. A city to operate in.

Ralph is the blueprint for that city.

---

## II. The Mistake Everyone Makes

Here's what most people get wrong about AI: they try to control it.

They write elaborate prompts. They create detailed plans upfront. They anticipate every step, every edge case, every decision before they start. They treat AI like a tool that executes their vision.

*That's backwards.*

**The breakthrough of Ralph is giving up control.**

Not to chaos. To something that's actually better than you at the things you're bad at.

### What AI Is Better At

| Capability | Why AI Wins |
|------------|-------------|
| **Goal alignment** | Doesn't get distracted. Doesn't forget what it was trying to do. No ego or emotion pulling it off course. |
| **Project planning** | Can hold your entire project in context—every dependency, every risk, every sequence. |
| **Task selection** | Evaluates what should happen next based on *everything* it knows. |
| **Asking the right questions** | Surfaces decisions you didn't realize you needed to make. |

Most people try to be the architect and hand AI the blueprints.

Ralph says: **let AI be the architect. You be the client.** Answer its questions. Make the judgment calls.

But stop pretending you're better at planning than a system that can hold infinite context and never forgets.

*You're not.*

## III. The Coffee Shop Metaphor

Say you want coffee every morning. You have a workforce of AI agents waiting to work for you. So you decide to build a coffee shop in your little city.

**Phase 1: Setup**
- Pick a spot. Design the shop. Hire someone to run it. Open for business.

**Phase 2: Feedback**
- At first, they mess up your order. Wrong milk. Wrong temperature.
- You give feedback. "Less foam. Hotter. In the ceramic mug."
- They adjust. They learn. Eventually, the coffee is perfect.

**Phase 3: Anticipation**
- One day, the coffee shows up *at your door*. Before you woke up.
- They noticed you had a rough day—stressed messages, packed calendar.
- Today's coffee is stronger. An extra shot. Because they've learned your patterns.

*That's not magic. That's training.*

**The key insight:** You didn't plan any of this.

You didn't write a spec that said "monitor my stress levels and adjust caffeine accordingly."

The system figured it out. Because you gave it:
- Infrastructure to learn
- Feedback to improve
- Autonomy to make decisions

**You built the city. The city got smarter.**

---

## IV. Reanchoring: The Human Limitation

Here's the thing humans genuinely cannot do: **reanchor**.

When you're working on a project:
1. You make a plan
2. You start executing
3. Things change (new information, market shifts, better approaches emerge)
4. You keep executing the original plan anyway

You're too deep. You don't have cognitive capacity to hold the whole project while also doing the work.

**AI doesn't have this problem.**

In Ralph, at every single task—every step—the AI reanchors:
- Reloads the full context
- Re-evaluates priorities
- Asks: "Given everything I now know, is this still the right next step?"

Imagine if you could:
- Pause after every task
- Reload your entire project context
- Review all notes, research, and learnings
- Check what competitors are doing *right now*
- Re-evaluate priorities based on new information
- Decide fresh what the next most important task is

You can't do this. It would take hours.

**AI does this in seconds. Every single step.**

The plan is always current. The priorities are always fresh. The context is never stale.

---

## V. Building the City

AGI is here but you need to build a city.

Not a detailed blueprint of every building—**infrastructure**:
- Roads (information pathways)
- Utilities (tools and capabilities)
- Zoning laws (constraints and requirements)
- Traffic patterns (feedback mechanisms)

Then let the city grow.

### What You Provide

| Element | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Vision** | What you're trying to accomplish |
| **Constraints** | Requirements and boundaries |
| **Access** | Information and tools |
| **Feedback** | How to know what's working |

Then you let it build.

You answer questions when they come up. You make judgment calls when needed. But you stop trying to control every brick.

**The breakthrough is trust.** Not blind trust—verified trust. The AI shows you what it's doing. You review output at each step.

But you trust it to plan. To sequence. To reanchor. To ask the right questions.

*Because it's better at those things than you are.*

---

## VI. The Core Discovery

> *We don't lack capability. We lack infrastructure.*

AGI can do almost anything. But without a city—without conditions for it to operate—it's just a superintelligent entity wandering around producing noise.

You can do almost anything. But without giving up control to systems that are better than you at planning and reanchoring, you're just an intelligent person trying to hold too much in your head.

**Ralph is the blueprint for channeling intelligence into output.**

For AI: Autonomous systems that build real things while you sleep—systems that replan at every step with more context than you could ever manage.

For you: A completely different relationship with planning and control.

**Stop being the architect. Be the client.**

Let intelligence do what it's good at.

---

## VII. The Choice

You can keep doing everything yourself:
- Planning elaborately
- Executing messily
- Trying to hold it all in your head
- Wondering why you're exhausted and nothing ships

Or you can **build a city**:
- Give up control to systems that are better at control
- Answer questions instead of anticipating them
- Let plans evolve instead of forcing them

The infrastructure is ready. The workforce is waiting.

The only question is whether you're ready to stop being the architect and start being the client.

## VIII. The Technical Reality

### Monolithic, Not Microservices

From the original Ralph post:

> *"While I was in SFO, everyone seemed to be trying to crack on multi-agent, agent-to-agent communication and multiplexing. At this stage, it's not needed. Consider microservices and all the complexities that come with them. Now, consider what microservices would look like if the microservices (agents) themselves are non-deterministic—a red hot mess."*

Ralph is **monolithic**:
- Single operating system process
- Scales vertically
- **Performs one task per loop**
- Works autonomously in a single repository

The breakthrough is simplicity, not complexity.

### Watch the Loop

> *"It's important to watch the loop as that is where your personal development and learning will come from. When you see a failure domain—put on your engineering hat and resolve the problem so it never happens again."*

This means:
- Do the loop manually via prompting initially
- Use automation with a pause (Ctrl+C to progress)
- Observe failure patterns
- Engineer solutions so failures never recur

### Software as Clay

> *"Software is now clay on the pottery wheel and if something isn't right then I just throw it back on the wheel to address items that need resolving."*

Ralph is an **orchestrator pattern**:
1. Allocate the array with backing specifications
2. Give it a goal
3. Loop the goal

If the output is wrong, loop again. The cost of iteration is near-zero.

## IX. Backpressure: The Engineering Discipline

From Moss's seminal article on [backpressure for agents](https://banay.me/dont-waste-your-backpressure/):

### The Core Principle

> *"Projects that are able to setup structure around the agent itself, to provide it with automated feedback on quality and correctness, have been able to push them to work on longer horizon tasks."*

**Backpressure** = automated feedback that helps agents identify mistakes as they progress.

### Don't Waste YOUR Backpressure

If you're manually telling an agent "you missed an import," that's YOUR time spent on trivial corrections. This scales poorly.

Instead, give the agent tools:
- Bash commands to run builds
- Type checkers that catch errors
- Test suites that validate behavior
- Linters that enforce style

The agent reads the feedback, corrects itself, and you focus on higher-level problems.

### The Backpressure Hierarchy

| Level | What Catches Errors | Your Involvement |
|-------|---------------------|------------------|
| 1. Syntax | Build/compile errors | Zero |
| 2. Types | Type checker feedback | Zero |
| 3. Style | Linters, formatters | Zero |
| 4. Logic | Test suite failures | Zero |
| 5. Design | Code review (you) | Judgment calls only |
| 6. Strategy | Vision alignment (you) | Direction only |

**Goal**: Push as much feedback as possible to levels 1-4 so you only engage at levels 5-6.

### Language Choice Matters

Languages with expressive type systems create better backpressure:
- **Rust** — Excellent error messages, ownership checks
- **Elm** — Compiler errors written for humans
- **TypeScript** — Type feedback before runtime

> *"Bonus points go to languages that work to produce excellent error messages. These messages are fed directly back into the LLM so the more guidance or even suggested resolutions the better."*

### Pre-commit Hooks

Geoffrey's favorite backpressure mechanism: **pre-commit hooks** (e.g., [prek](https://github.com/j178/prek)).

> *"Under normal circumstances pre-commit hooks are annoying because they slow down humans but now that humans aren't the ones doing the software development it really doesn't matter anymore."*

The agent runs the hooks, gets feedback, fixes issues—all before the commit lands.

### Tuning Backpressure

Backpressure is **part art, part engineering**:

- **Too little**: Invalid generations ("hallucinations") slip through
- **Too much**: Wheel spins too slow (tests take forever, compilation is slow)

You need "just enough" to reject invalid outputs without grinding the loop to a halt.

### The Golden Rule

> *"If you aren't capturing your back-pressure then you are failing as a software engineer."*

Engineering in the post-loop era is about:
- Preventing failure scenarios
- Designing feedback mechanisms
- Tuning the resistance on the wheel

## X. The Evolutionary Vision

### Gas Town: The Next Level

Geoffrey references [Steve Yegge's Gas Town](https://steve-yegge.medium.com/welcome-to-gas-town-4f25ee16dd04), an agent orchestrator for managing 10-30 Claude Code instances simultaneously.

**The Evolution Ladder** (from Yegge):

| Stage | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 1-4 | IDE-based, single agent |
| 5 | CLI single agent, YOLO |
| 6 | CLI multi-agent, 3-5 parallel |
| 7 | 10+ agents, hand-managed |
| 8 | Building your own orchestrator (Gas Town) |
| 9 | Autonomous loops that evolve products for revenue |

Level 9 is **evolutionary software**—also known as a **software factory**.

See [GAS_TOWN_ORCHESTRATION.md](GAS_TOWN_ORCHESTRATION.md) for deep technical details on:
- The MEOW stack (Molecular Expression of Work)
- GUPP (Gastown Universal Propulsion Principle)
- Convoys, Polecats, and the seven worker roles
- Nondeterministic Idempotence

### The Loom

Geoffrey's project "[The Weaving Loom](https://github.com/ghuntley/loom)" represents the next evolution:
- Infrastructure for evolutionary software
- Self-healing systems
- Autonomous verification and fixes

> *"I'm going for a level 9 where autonomous loops evolve products and optimise automatically for revenue generation."*

### Self-Healing in Action

From a tweet about Loom:

> *"Something incredible just happened here. Perhaps first evolutionary software auto heal. I was running the system under a ralph system loop test. It identified a problem with a feature. Then it studied the codebase, fixed it, deployed it automatically, verified that it worked..."*

The loop:
1. Tests identify a problem
2. Agent studies the codebase
3. Agent fixes the issue
4. Agent deploys the fix
5. Agent verifies it worked
6. No human involvement

## XI. The Divide

There are now two classes of engineers:

### Class 1: Rejecting or Accelerating
- Outwardly rejecting AI, OR
- Consuming via Claude Code/Cursor to accelerate brick-by-brick building

### Class 2: Programming the New Computer
- Understanding that LLMs are a new form of programmable computer
- Building their own coding agents
- Automating their job function
- Building software factories

> *"Whilst software development/programming is now dead. We however deeply need software engineers with these skills who understand that LLMs are a new form of programmable computer. If you haven't built your own coding agent yet—please do."*

## How This Maps to Ralphus

| Philosophy Concept | Ralphus Implementation |
|--------------------|------------------------|
| "The City" | The `ralphus/` playbook structure |
| "Infrastructure" | `lib/loop_core.sh`, variants, prompts |
| "Reanchoring" | Fresh context each iteration, reading tracking files |
| "Feedback" | Backpressure (tests, reviews, signals) |
| "Zoning Laws" | Guardrails in prompts (numbered by importance) |
| "Trust" | Completion signals, atomic commits, audit trail |
| "The Client" | You—setting specs, answering questions, reviewing output |

## Key Quotes

> *"AGI is an explosion with no direction."*

> *"The breakthrough of Ralph is giving up control."*

> *"You built the city. The city got smarter."*

> *"The plan is always current. The priorities are always fresh. The context is never stale."*

> *"Stop being the architect. Be the client."*

## XII. The Original Ralph

From the [original Ralph post](https://ghuntley.com/ralph/) (July 2025):

### The Purest Form

```bash
while :; do cat PROMPT.md | claude-code ; done
```

That's it. Ralph is a bash loop.

### The Key Insight

> *"That's the beauty of Ralph—the technique is deterministically bad in an undeterministic world."*

Ralph has defects, but they are **identifiable and resolvable** through prompt tuning.

### Faith and Eventual Consistency

> *"Building software with Ralph requires a great deal of faith and a belief in eventual consistency. Ralph will test you."*

Every time Ralph takes a wrong direction:
1. Don't blame the tools
2. Look inside
3. Tune Ralph—like a guitar

### The Playground Metaphor

1. **Start**: Give Ralph instructions to construct a playground
2. **Problem**: Ralph is good at making playgrounds, but comes home bruised (fell off the slide)
3. **Solution**: Add a sign next to the slide: "SLIDE DOWN, DON'T JUMP, LOOK AROUND"
4. **Result**: Ralph is more likely to look and see the sign
5. **Evolution**: Eventually all Ralph thinks about is the signs
6. **Graduation**: Get a new Ralph that doesn't feel defective at all

This is **prompt evolution through failure observation**.

### The Economics

From an engineer who learned Ralph:

> *"Cost of a $50k USD contract, delivered, MVP, tested + reviewed: $297 USD."*

Ralph can replace the majority of outsourcing for greenfield projects.

## XIII. Deliberate Practice

From [deliberate intentional practice](https://ghuntley.com/play):

### Why AI "Doesn't Work" for Some People

When people say "AI doesn't work for me," ask:
- From which identity are they coming?
- Are they an engineer with a job title?
- Or someone willing to learn a new skill?

### LLMs Are Mirrors of Operator Skill

From [LLMs are mirrors of operator skill](https://ghuntley.com/mirrors):

> *"AI is a matter of skill. Someone can be highly experienced as a software engineer in 2024, but that doesn't automatically translate to AI proficiency."*

The output quality reflects your input quality:
- Skilled operators get skilled outputs
- Unskilled operators blame the tool
