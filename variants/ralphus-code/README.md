# Ralphus Code

Autonomous feature implementation from specs.

## How It Works

1. You write specs in `specs/*.md` describing what to build
2. **Plan mode** generates `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` with prioritized tasks
3. **Build mode** picks tasks one by one, implements them, commits, and loops

## Quick Start

```bash
# Copy to your project
cp -r path/to/ralphus/variants/ralphus-code ./ralphus/ralphus-code

# Create specs
mkdir -p specs
cat > specs/my-feature.md << 'EOF'
# My Feature

## Requirements
- User can do X
- System responds with Y

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] X works
- [ ] Y is correct
EOF

# Run planning (generates IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md)
./ralphus/ralphus-code/scripts/loop.sh plan

# Run build loop
./ralphus/ralphus-code/scripts/loop.sh
```

## Directory Requirements

Your project must have:
```
your-project/
├── specs/                     # REQUIRED: Your specifications
│   └── *.md
├── IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md     # Generated by plan mode
└── ralphus/
    └── ralphus-code/          # This variant
```

## Usage

```bash
./ralphus/ralphus-code/scripts/loop.sh plan        # Planning mode
./ralphus/ralphus-code/scripts/loop.sh             # Build mode (unlimited)
./ralphus/ralphus-code/scripts/loop.sh 20          # Build mode (max 20 iterations)
./ralphus/ralphus-code/scripts/loop.sh ulw         # Ultrawork mode (aggressive)
```

## Completion Signals

| Signal | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `<promise>PLAN_COMPLETE</promise>` | Planning done, run build mode |
| `<promise>PHASE_COMPLETE</promise>` | One task done, loop continues |
| `<promise>COMPLETE</promise>` | All tasks done |
| `<promise>BLOCKED:[task]:[reason]</promise>` | Stuck, needs human help |

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `RALPH_AGENT` | `Sisyphus` | OpenCode agent to use |
| `OPENCODE_BIN` | `opencode` | Path to OpenCode binary |
