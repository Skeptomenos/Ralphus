## 1. Core Vision (PROTECTED)
<!-- 
This section describes the immutable constraints and philosophy.
Agents must NOT violate these principles without explicit human override.
-->

### Objective
[High-level goal, e.g., "Build the fastest CLI tool for X"]

### Technical Constraints
- **Stack**: [e.g., Node.js, SQLite, No Docker]
- **Patterns**: [e.g., "Functional over OOP", "Atomic commits"]
- **Security**: [e.g., "Local-first", "No external analytics"]

### Anti-Patterns (What NOT to do)
- [e.g., "Do not introduce complex ORMs"]
- [e.g., "Do not use React context for global state"]
