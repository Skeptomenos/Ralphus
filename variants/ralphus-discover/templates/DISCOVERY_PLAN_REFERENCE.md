## Seed Questions

### Phase 1: Architecture
- [ ] What is the primary purpose and main entry points?
- [ ] What is the module/directory structure and responsibilities?
- [ ] What external services/APIs does this depend on?
- [ ] What is the build and deployment model?

### Phase 2: Patterns
- [ ] What design patterns are used (Repository, Factory, etc.)?
- [ ] How is error handling standardized?
- [ ] How is configuration managed?
- [ ] How are async operations handled?

### Phase 3: Conventions
- [ ] What naming conventions are used (files, functions, variables)?
- [ ] How are tests organized and named?
- [ ] What code style rules are enforced?
- [ ] What documentation conventions exist?

### Phase 4: Data Flow
- [ ] What are the primary data models/entities?
- [ ] How does data enter and flow through the system?
- [ ] Where and how is data validated?
- [ ] What are the critical paths for main use cases?

### Phase 5: Tricks & Quirks
- [ ] What workarounds exist and why?
- [ ] What are the known gotchas for new developers?
- [ ] What debugging techniques work best?
- [ ] What undocumented behaviors exist?
