## Answer

[Direct answer to the question in 1-3 paragraphs]

## Evidence

[Code references, file paths, and specific examples that support the answer]

```
// Example code snippet if relevant
```

- `path/to/another.ts` — [why it's relevant]

## Implications

[What this discovery means for working in this codebase]

- When doing X, remember to Y
- This pattern suggests Z approach for new code

## Follow-up Questions

<!-- CRITICAL: Generate 1-2 follow-ups per discovery -->
<!-- Only 0 if you genuinely found nothing new to explore -->
<!-- These get added to DISCOVERY_PLAN.md Phase 6: Follow-ups -->

Ask yourself: "What new questions emerged while investigating this?"

- [ ] [New question that digs deeper into something surprising]
- [ ] [Question exploring connections to other parts of codebase]
